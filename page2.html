        <h2>My education</h2>
        <p>
            I went to primary school at OU ,,Goce Delcev"-Tetovo. I finished every year with perfect grades and then when it was time
            to think about my future (in which High School was i going to go) i had a big dilemma.
        </p>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Knowing that the High School in Tetovo had fallen a long way from where it had been in terms of teachers and
             education, i decided to go to ,,Rade Jovcevski-Korcagin"
            It was a big challenge, but i managed to finish all my years with perfect grades, and that gave me the boost
            to go on and continue my university education at FINKI.</p>
            <p>You can find information about the High School and Finki at the links below:</p>
